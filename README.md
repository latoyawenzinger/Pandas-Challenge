# Pandas-Challenge


Various data from 15 schools, and every student's math and reading scores were aggregated to showcase obvious trends in school performance.

School performance was categorized by: 

-Average math score

-Average reading score

-% passing math (the percentage of students who passed math)

-% passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)

-% overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading)


A further investigation involved grouping the schools by student population size, budget per student, and school type.
